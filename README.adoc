# WORK IN PROGRESS

This example demonstrates how to map node and relationships to Ruby classes.

## How to install

    bundle install

## How to run

    # with rackup
    NEO4J_USERNAME=username NEO4J_PASSWORD=password bundle exec rackup config.ru

    # with shotgun for for development / reloading
    NEO4J_USERNAME=username NEO4J_PASSWORD=password bundle exec shotgun config.ru

If your neo4j server is not running on `localhost:7474` then you can specify an
alternate location with an environment variable named `NEO4J_URL`.

## Design

This example is very slow if used from the Neo4j Server since it does a lot of requests instead of using just one cypher query (as in the neo4j-core example).
Notice that Neo4j.rb tries to hide the internal Neo4j ids. Instead in the example we have created primary keys on title and name properties.
